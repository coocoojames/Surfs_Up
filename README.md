# Surfs_Up
## Purpose
&emsp; The main purpose of this analysis is to look at summer and winter temperatures recorded in the past 
few years and look at the difference, average, and pattern.

## Results
- In June we can see that the average temperature over the past few years has been 74 °F.
- In December we can see that the average temperature o has been 71 °F.
- The coldest ever in the past few years in December has been 56 °F.
- It was also recorded to have been 83 °F in December.<br />

## Summary
&emsp; The entries of both June and December data are fairly large with June having 1700 and December having 1517.
Looking at the different statistics we can tell that Hawaii is an ideal place for people who are escaping the 
winter and people who are escaping a 100 degree summer. With only a 3 degree difference between the average 
temperatures of the two months, we can see that Hawaii is truly a vacation paradise.<br />
&emsp; If one wanted to get the sense of how much rain there is and the difference, we could write a query 
to get the average precipitation of both June and December. And if one were to be interested in how many 
times it actually gets to above 80 °F, we can write a query to get the count of all the occurance.
